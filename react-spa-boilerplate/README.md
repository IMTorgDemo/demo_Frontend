# Boilerplate: Single Page Application in React

This is boilerplate code for an SPA in React.  It includes:
  * babel
  * bootstrap without js
  * react.router already set-up


# Quickstart

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

# ToDo

Re-create using `create-react-app` and ensuring you understand all components.
